I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow at the College of Design & Engineering, National University of Singapore (NUS). Prior to joining NUS, I obtained my Ph.D. degree from the Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), and was very fortunate to be supervised by Prof. [http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~hchen/ Huanhuan Chen]. I was a visiting research student once with the DATA Lab, Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Texas A&M University. Before that, I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree from the College of Science, Northwest A&F University (NWAFU).
