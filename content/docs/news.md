I'm so proud to announce that I was placed on the Reserve List under the HORIZON EUROPE [Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions Postdoctoral Fellowships](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/postdoctoral-fellowships) Call 2022, one of the most prestigious postdoctoral fellowships in Europe even the world, and was awarded a [Seal of Excellence](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/seal-excellence_en) certificate, which means that my proposal was recognised as a high-quality project proposal by the European Commission but could not receive funding due to budgetary constraints.
